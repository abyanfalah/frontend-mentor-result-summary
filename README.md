## My process
Started with just creating the 2 main sections and all the text without any style, i utilize Vue for the summary aspects so i can just iterate through it. Then i apply the layout with flexbox. Setting the colors from the style guide as custom colors in tailwind configuration. And finally applying the layout for bigger screen using tailwindcss.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

I've been learning web backend development all this time, so frontend stuff is still a new thing to me. In this challenge i practiced mobile-frist workflow and applying responsive design, and most importantly my slicing skill is getting better. Thanks to TailwindCSS i don't have to deal with css directly.


### Useful resources

- TailwindCSS documentation, because i'm currently learning to use it.
- Stack Overflow, because... Stack Overflow.
- Vue documentation. I love Vue.
